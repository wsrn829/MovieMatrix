# MovieMatrix

This movie app is an enhanced version of MovieMaster, where I will incorporate more sophisticated techniques to realize more complex features. I will also note down all the processes for better internalization and for future projects.

1. Download node.js from official website and install (if you haven't already);
2. In project terminal, run: `npx create-react-app ./`;
3. `npm install` will install all the dependencies listed in package.json and generate node_modules folder.
4.
